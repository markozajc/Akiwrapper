/**
 * A representation of multiple {@link Server}s at once. While a single
 * {@link Server} instance is <i>usually</i> enough, it might go down. Akiwrapper
 * will in that case automatically find the next available one in a given
 * {@link ServerList}, until it hits into one that is available. If none are
 * available, it will fail with a {@link ServerUnavailableException}.<br>
 * Note: being available means succeeding to create a new session. Failure can mean
 * that either:
 * <ul>
 * <li>the server is down, which is very unlikely, but is the best case scenario
 * since no code needs to be fixed,
 * <li>or that Akinator has changed something and Akiwrapper doesn't yet support the
 * change, causing failure on a new session.
 * </ul>
 * The {@link ServerList} acts similarly to a {@link Matcher} or a {@link ResultSet}
 * - you can use it the same way as you would a regular {@link Server}, and if it is
 * down or does not work, you can call {@link #next()} to seamlessly switch to the
 * next instance.
